# IBM Employee attrition with RF & GBM
Attrition in human resources refers to the gradual loss of employees over time. In general, relatively high attrition is a form of loss for the employer. This notebook is for predicting employee attrition on this synthetically generated IBM dataset. I have constructed a very simple pipeline of predicting employee attrition, including some basic Exploratory Data Analysis, feature engineering as well as implementing two learning models in the form of a Random Forest (accuracy 87%) and a Gradient Boosting classifier (accuracy 88%).
